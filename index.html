<h1> Stray Animals In Uzbekistan</h1>

<p>Just like us, dogs and cats also need food, shelter, water, medical care, and love.
Yet thousands of animals in Uzbekistan have no one to take care of them. According to
 “Mehr va Oqibat” the first and only non-profit animal rights organization, there are
  more than 120 000 dogs and cats live in the streets in the capital of Uzbekistan. Though,
  there are 11 more provinces here. for instance, in my hometown, there is not a single animal shelter.

</p>
<p>   On top of that, most people don’t welcome homeless animals.
  Instead, they throw stones at dogs and cats even if they are innocent and harmless.
   They ignore when their children harm animals. Most people in Uzbekistan didn’t
   realize yet that animals are also living things, they can feel pain, fear, and love
   just like us. The only difference is that we have intelligence, and it means that we should
    help them, care for them, and not kill them.

   <p>Stray animals in Uzbekistan live in fear and pain. They don’t know what it
     would be like to be loved or cared for, and they are treated like objects.
     Every day, I see it with my own eyes and can do nothing. According to the statistics
     between 2014 and 2018 “Mehr va Oqibat” animal protection society received 3588
     complaints about animal cruelty. The saddest thing is that the fine for animal
      cruelty is only 50 US dollars while it is a federal crime in the US. It is hard
       to believe that one doesn’t repeat his crime after paying a 50 dollar fine.

     <h1> Let's Care About Paws</h1>
     <p>There are two most common reasons that why most animals end up in the streets:</p>
     <ul>
       <li>	Most animals are relinquished by their owners</li>
       <li>	Many strays are lost pets that were not kept properly</li>
     </ul>
     <h2>How to reduce the number of strays</h2>
     <ul>
       <li>Think carefully before you buy or adopt a pet that do you really need it, can you afford to keep it</li>
       <li>	Never buy from breeders. Adopt from shelters. Give them a chance to have a family.</li>
       <li>	Microchip your pet</li>
       <li>Stand against Puppy Mils </li>
       <li>Report stray pets	</li>
       <li>	Keep your pet for life!</li>

     </ul>
     <h2>How to help stray animals</h2>
     <p>The best and effective way is to educate people and raise awareness in the
       community. Talking to people can dramatically improve the welfare of stray animals.
       If you see a stray dog or cat in your area, you can help them, but you should be cautious.
       Never ever approach them. You may have good intensions, but you can never know what is it
       thinking about. They may feel scared if you go too close and could bite you. Instead, call
       your local animal rescue center.  Let the experts do their work for the safety of the animal
       and anyone else. For more information click <a href="https://www.humanesociety.org/resources/how-help-stray-pet">here</a>
